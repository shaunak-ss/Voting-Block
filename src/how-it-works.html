        <p class="lead" style="font-weight: 550;">Standing in the queue and waiting for your turn to cast vote is a part of a history now. </p>

        <p>Election Commission of India proposes a new system of voting where everything is transparent and no question
          of tampering the voting machine as it doesn't exists in first place.</p>

        <p>Voting Block is the upcoming way of casting vote where all the votes will be stored in the Blockchain, which
          makes the system tamper proof and fully transparent.</p>
